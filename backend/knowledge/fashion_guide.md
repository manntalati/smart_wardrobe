# Fashion Style Guide — Knowledge Base for RAG

## Color Coordination Fundamentals

Neutral colors form the foundation of any well-dressed wardrobe. Black, white, navy, grey, and beige pair with virtually anything. Build outfits around one neutral base and add 1-2 accent colors. The rule of three: limit your outfit to three colors maximum for a cohesive look.

Complementary colors (opposite on the color wheel) create striking combinations: navy and orange, purple and yellow, teal and coral. Use one as a dominant and the other as an accent. Analogous colors (neighbors on the wheel) like blue-green-teal create harmonious, sophisticated looks.

Monochromatic outfits (varying shades of one color) look effortlessly chic. Mix textures within the same color family — a charcoal knit sweater with dark grey wool pants and black leather boots.

## Occasion Dressing

### Casual Everyday
Casual doesn't mean sloppy. Well-fitting jeans, a quality t-shirt or sweater, and clean sneakers form the foundation. Layer with jackets, cardigans, or hoodies for added interest. Accessories like watches, simple jewelry, or a good bag elevate casual looks.

### Business/Work Professional
For traditional offices, stick to structured pieces: blazers, tailored pants, button-down shirts, and closed-toe shoes. Neutral colors dominate: navy, charcoal, black, white, and subtle patterns. A well-fitted blazer transforms almost any outfit into workwear.

### Formal Events
Suits, cocktail dresses, and evening wear. Dark colors (black, navy, deep burgundy) are safe choices. Fabrics should be refined: wool, silk, satin. Shoes should be polished and elegant — heels or dress shoes.

### Smart Casual
The intersection of casual and professional. Dark jeans or chinos with a collared shirt, loafers or clean sneakers. Blazers are optional but add polish. Avoid athletic wear and overly casual pieces.

### Athletic/Outdoor
Performance fabrics, moisture-wicking materials, and weather-appropriate layers. Comfort and function over style, but coordinated colors still matter. Quality athletic shoes for the specific activity.

## Seasonal Styling

### Spring/Summer
Lightweight, breathable fabrics: cotton, linen, chambray. Light colors reflect heat. Short sleeves, shorts, sundresses. Open-toed shoes acceptable in casual settings. Layer with a light cardigan or denim jacket for cooler evenings.

### Fall/Winter
Layering is key. Start with a base layer (t-shirt or thin sweater), add a mid-layer (sweater, cardigan, or fleece), and top with an outer layer (coat, jacket). Warm fabrics: wool, cashmere, fleece, down. Rich, deep colors — burgundy, forest green, mustard, charcoal. Boots, scarves, and hats complete the look.

### Transitional Seasons
Light jackets, trench coats, and versatile layers. Pieces that can be added or removed as temperatures fluctuate throughout the day. Closed-toe shoes in breathable materials.

## Fabric Guide

Cotton is the most versatile fabric — breathable, comfortable, and easy to care for. Best for t-shirts, casual shirts, and everyday basics. Denim (cotton twill) is a casual staple for jeans and jackets.

Linen is ideal for hot weather — lightweight and breathable. Wrinkles are natural and add character. Best for summer shirts, pants, and dresses.

Wool provides warmth and drapes beautifully. Ideal for suits, sweaters, coats, and winter accessories. Merino wool is finer and can be worn year-round.

Silk adds luxury and elegance. Best for formal blouses, ties, and evening wear. Requires careful handling.

Leather (real or faux) adds edge and structure. Jackets, boots, belts, and bags in leather are wardrobe investments.

Synthetic fabrics (polyester, nylon) offer durability and stretch. Best for athletic wear and performance clothing.

## Building a Capsule Wardrobe

A capsule wardrobe consists of 30-40 versatile, high-quality pieces that mix and match seamlessly. Essential categories include: 5-7 tops, 3-4 bottoms, 2-3 dresses/suits, 2-3 outerwear pieces, 3-4 pairs of shoes, and selected accessories. Focus on neutral bases with a few accent pieces.

The cost-per-wear principle: invest more in items you wear frequently (quality basics, outerwear, shoes) and spend less on trendy statement pieces. A $200 jacket worn 100 times costs $2 per wear — better value than a $30 jacket worn 5 times.

## Pattern Mixing Rules

When mixing patterns, vary the scale: pair a bold stripe with a subtle check. Keep them in the same color family. The safest pattern-mixing formula: one bold pattern + one subtle pattern + one solid. Solid pieces always balance an outfit with patterns.

Stripes are the most versatile pattern — they pair with nearly any other pattern. Florals and stripes work surprisingly well together. Plaid and polka dots can clash, so pair each with solids instead.

## Fit and Proportion

Fit is more important than brand or price. Clothes that fit properly always look more polished than expensive ill-fitting pieces. Balance proportions: if wearing a loose top, pair with fitted bottoms, and vice versa. A structured blazer over a relaxed t-shirt creates visual interest through contrast.

High-waisted bottoms elongate the legs. Tucking in shirts at the front creates a polished silhouette. Rolling sleeves adds a casual, intentional touch. Cuffing jeans shows off shoes and adds a style detail.
